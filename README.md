# Automated_Interview_ML-Project
The goal of automated interviews is to make it possible to create virtual interviewers that can evaluate job candidates. This assesses applicant answers and gives hiring managers comments using machine learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP). This system's primary goal is to expedite the interview procedure and cut down on the time and resources used for conventional, manual interviews.

The stability and fairness of this approach are among its main advantages. The Automated Interview Application is designed to adhere to a uniform set of guidelines and offer unbiased feedback, in contrast to human interviewers who could be biased or deliver inconsistent ratings. This ensures that all applicants are examined equally and helps to remove any potential biases. Furthermore, computerized interviews may be tailored to fit the specific needs and requirements of a company, allowing for a more tailored and efficient interview process.

Another advantage of automated interviews is their scalability. They can be used to interview many candidates in a short period of time, making them ideal for companies with high volumes of applicants. This is particularly useful for companies that are hiring for multiple positions or for remote hiring, where it may not be possible to conduct in-person interviews.
